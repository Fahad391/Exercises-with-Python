# Exercises-with-Python

This is an practice session I built for Myself. I come up with problems and solve them Myself.
Purpose is to challange Myself on what I learned. I put them in test with these problems solving and mark my progress. 

I upload them on Github as a reccord of My learning progress by applying them on such exercises.

These are not real projects. These are just console based problems I solved.
With fundamentals strenghtened I will start to do real problem solving.
This repo just shows My little start as a comeback learner.
