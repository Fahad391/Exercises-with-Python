# Exercises-with-Python

This is an practice session I built for Myself. I come up with problems and solve them Myself.
Purpose is to challange Myself on what I learned. I put them in test with these problems solving and mark my progress. 

I upload them on Github as a reccord of My learning progress by applying them on such exercises.
